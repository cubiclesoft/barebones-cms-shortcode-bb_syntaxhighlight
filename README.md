Barebones CMS - Syntax Highlighter shortcode
============================================

Adds a new shortcode to the content editor that makes it easy to embed highlighted source code (PHP, Javascript, C/C++, etc.) that leverages a third-party Javascript library with some modifications to improve certain languages.  Designed to show various source code examples in a user-friendly fashion.

Leverages Alex Gorbatchev's third-party library SyntaxHighlighter (ver 2.1.382).  (http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter)
